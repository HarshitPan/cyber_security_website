Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidental information . <br><br>
Social engineers often rely on the natural helpfulness of people as well as on their weaknesses . <br>
The criminals are usually trying to trick you into giving them your passwords or bank information, or access 
your computer by using human psychology or by secretly installing malicious software that will give them 
access to your passwords and bank information as well as giving them control over your computer.
<br><br>
<font color="white">Example- </font>
 The Social Engineer may pretent to be a technical support from one of the organization's software
vendors to gain information. The attacker explains that he is troubleshooting a network problem and has
narrowed the problem to a certain computer. He claims to need a user ID and password from that 
computer to finish tracing the problem . Unless the user has been properly educated in security practices 
, they will likely give the "trouble-shooter" the information requested .
