<font color="pink"><b><u>1. Set strong Password :</u></b></font>
A mistake many people do is to use simple words that often contain their names or other regular words . 
These are easy to guess and break into by hackers . You should use strong passwords that are long , mix 
capital and lowercase letters , numbers and symbols . 
<br><br>
<font color="pink"><b><u>2. Don't use the same password for different Accounts :</u></b></font>
Another common mistakes that many people make is that they use the same password for logging onto 
their computer , their facebook profile and even their bank account . So in this case , if your password is 
stolen or disclosed to a person who wants to harm you , he or she could get access to all your information 
with just one password . It is like using the same key for multiple locks . The solution is to use different 
passwords for different accounts and websites .
